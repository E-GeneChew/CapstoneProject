		This website is the geoportfolio of E-Gene Chew. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of Surveying
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I was born in Malaysia before migrating over to Melbourne, Australia in 2012 and as of September 2024, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My surveying-related interests is working on large infrastructure projects like the Metro Tunnel project, Melbourne's Level Crossing
		Removal Project (LXRP), the Suburban Rail Loop (SRL) and the North-East Link. I also enjoy obtaining and analysing aerial-captured imagery and creating maps using spatial data. My current
		capstone surveying project involve the development of a new web-based agricultural land management mobile mapping application with GIS software and Trimble Business Centre to foster increased
		effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity in farming practices.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include playing sports like badminton!

	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both the geospatial science and surveying degrees. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		I completed this course in the COVID impacted year of 2021, where the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program ArcScene and the raw data was
			also modified in ArcGIS Pro. The proposed pathway was created using ArcGIS Pro by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		Cartography 2 consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->

			Below are the three maps that I have created as part of my course:

		My time with SmartX as a part-time Student Surveyor has equipped me with many geospatial and suveying skills and knowledge required in the industry. I have also been able to 
		apply my knowledge from being a current full-time student at RMIT University in the workforce in the industry. My time working with SmartX has also taught me what work is done
		within the surveying industry. I chose to work at SmartX as I was referred by another surveyor in the industry whilst I was simultaneously seeking work in a City-based employer.
		The work at SmartX covers a variety of surveying, geospatial and engineering components. These include equipment hire, land surveys, machine control, 
		scan to Built-in Modelling (BIM), and GIS based work.
		<p>
		As part of the team at SmartX, I mainly work on the GIS component of projects, where I have used a combination of Trimble Business Centre (TBC), ArcGIS and QGIS to undertake data processing and cleanup for
		for the development of Field Apps or an online dashboard for our clients. Occasionally, when I'm out on the field, I conduct a mixture of photogrammetry work with UAV drones and
		As-Built survey pickup work for our clients. At SmartX, the equipment we use are the Trimble Total Stations, Laser Scanners, and GPS Controllers. The computer programs we use are TBC, AutoCAD and ArcGIS.
